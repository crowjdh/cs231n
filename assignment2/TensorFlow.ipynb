    "You've written a lot of code in this assignment to provide a whole host of neural network functionality. Dropout, Batch Norm, and 2D convolutions are some of the workhorses of deep learning in computer vision. You've also worked hard to make your code efficient and vectorized.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the last part of this assignment, though, we're going to leave behind your beautiful codebase and instead migrate to one of two popular deep learning frameworks: in this instance, TensorFlow (or PyTorch, if you switch over to that notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is it?\n",
    "TensorFlow is a system for executing computational graphs over Tensor objects, with native support for performing backpropogation for its Variables. In it, we work with Tensors which are n-dimensional arrays analogous to the numpy ndarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our code will now run on GPUs! Much faster training. Writing your own modules to run on GPUs is beyond the scope of this class, unfortunately.\n",
    "* We want you to be ready to use one of these frameworks for your project so you can experiment more efficiently than if you were writing every feature you want to use by hand. \n",
    "* We want you to stand on the shoulders of giants! TensorFlow and PyTorch are both excellent frameworks that will make your lives a lot easier, and now that you understand their guts, you are free to use them :) \n",
    "* We want you to be exposed to the sort of deep learning code you might run into in academia or industry. "

    "Otherwise, this notebook will walk you through much of what you need to do to train models in TensorFlow. See the end of the notebook for some links to helpful tutorials if you want to learn more or need further clarification on topics that aren't fully explained here."

    "### Things you should try:\n",
    "- **Filter size**: Above we used 7x7; this makes pretty pictures but smaller filters may be more efficient\n",
    "- **Number of filters**: Above we used 32 filters. Do more or fewer do better?\n",
    "- **Pooling vs Strided Convolution**: Do you use max pooling or just stride convolutions?\n",
    "- **Batch normalization**: Try adding spatial batch normalization after convolution layers and vanilla batch normalization after affine layers. Do your networks train faster?\n",
    "- **Network architecture**: The network above has two layers of trainable parameters. Can you do better with a deep network? Good architectures to try include:\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "    - [batchnorm-relu-conv]xN -> [affine]xM -> [softmax or SVM]\n",
    "- **Use TensorFlow Scope**: Use TensorFlow scope and/or [tf.layers](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/layers) to make it easier to write deeper networks. See [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers) for how to use `tf.layers`. \n",
    "- **Use Learning Rate Decay**: [As the notes point out](http://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-3/#anneal), decaying the learning rate might help the model converge. Feel free to decay every epoch, when loss doesn't change over an entire epoch, or any other heuristic you find appropriate. See the [Tensorflow documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/master/api_guides/python/train#Decaying_the_learning_rate) for learning rate decay.\n",
    "- **Global Average Pooling**: Instead of flattening and then having multiple affine layers, perform convolutions until your image gets small (7x7 or so) and then perform an average pooling operation to get to a 1x1 image picture (1, 1 , Filter#), which is then reshaped into a (Filter#) vector. This is used in [Google's Inception Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) (See Table 1 for their architecture).\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Add l2 weight regularization, or perhaps use [Dropout as in the TensorFlow MNIST tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips for training\n",
    "For each network architecture that you try, you should tune the learning rate and regularization strength. When doing this there are a couple important things to keep in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parameters are working well, you should see improvement within a few hundred iterations\n",
    "- Remember the coarse-to-fine approach for hyperparameter tuning: start by testing a large range of hyperparameters for just a few training iterations to find the combinations of parameters that are working at all.\n",
    "- Once you have found some sets of parameters that seem to work, search more finely around these parameters. You may need to train for more epochs.\n",
    "- You should use the validation set for hyperparameter search, and we'll save the test set for evaluating your architecture on the best parameters as selected by the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Going above and beyond\n",
    "If you are feeling adventurous there are many other features you can implement to try and improve your performance. You are **not required** to implement any of these; however they would be good things to try for extra credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Alternative update steps: For the assignment we implemented SGD+momentum, RMSprop, and Adam; you could try alternatives like AdaGrad or AdaDelta.\n",
    "- Alternative activation functions such as leaky ReLU, parametric ReLU, ELU, or MaxOut.\n",
    "- Model ensembles\n",
    "- Data augmentation\n",
    "- New Architectures\n",
    "  - [ResNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) where the input from the previous layer is added to the output.\n",
    "  - [DenseNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) where inputs into previous layers are concatenated together.\n",
    "  - [This blog has an in-depth overview](https://chatbotslife.com/resnets-highwaynets-and-densenets-oh-my-9bb15918ee32)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do decide to implement something extra, clearly describe it in the \"Extra Credit Description\" cell below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What we expect\n",
    "At the very least, you should be able to train a ConvNet that gets at **>= 70% accuracy on the validation set**. This is just a lower bound - if you are careful it should be possible to get accuracies much higher than that! Extra credit points will be awarded for particularly high-scoring models or unique approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the space below to experiment and train your network. The final cell in this notebook should contain the training and validation set accuracies for your final trained network.\n",
